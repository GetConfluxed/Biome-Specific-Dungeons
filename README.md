This mod adds variants of the vanilla dungeon for some of the various dungeons in the game. These dungeons are similar in design but made using different blocks. The biome specific variants can also have different mobs and loot! This mod is also expansible, meaning you can add your own dungeon variations. If you have questions or requests please join my Discord server.
